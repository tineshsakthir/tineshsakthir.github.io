Hereâ€™s an improved version with better flow and clarity:

---

This repository contains multiple mini projects, all hosted using GitHub Pages. I decided to keep all my projects in this single repository (`tineshsakthir.github.io`) to enable automatic hosting through GitHub Pages. The naming format (`myGitHubUsername.github.io`) allows for easy management and hosting of all my projects in one place.

Here are some of the projects hosted in this repository:

- **CGPA Calculator**: [tineshsakthir.github.io/Gpa_Cgpa_Calulator](https://tineshsakthir.github.io/Gpa_Cgpa_Calulator/)
- **Form Validation Using Regex**: [tineshsakthir.github.io/FormValidationUsingRegex](https://tineshsakthir.github.io/FormValidationUsingRegex/)
- **Ngpian Esports**: [tineshsakthir.github.io/NgpianEsports](https://tineshsakthir.github.io/NgpianEsports/)
- **TV Shows Search App**: [tineshsakthir.github.io/TVShowsSearchAApp](https://tineshsakthir.github.io/TVShowsSearchAApp/)
- **University App**: [tineshsakthir.github.io/UniversityApp](https://tineshsakthir.github.io/UniversityApp/)
- **Zava Event 2023**: [tineshsakthir.github.io/ZavaEvent@2023](https://tineshsakthir.github.io/ZavaEvent@2023/)

This version gives a more polished and structured feel while keeping all the key details. Let me know if you need any changes!
